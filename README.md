# API

### <mark style="color:blue;">1. What is API ?</mark>

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It defines a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.&#x20;

APIs enable developers to access and use the functionality of existing software systems or services to build new applications or extend existing ones.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2. API: Standards?</mark>

API standards define guidelines and conventions for API design and development.&#x20;

• Examples include RESTful API principles, JSON: API, and OpenAPl (formerly Swagger).&#x20;

• **RESTful API Principles:** Guidelines for building APIs that adhere to REST principles.&#x20;

• **JSON API:** A specification for building APIs that follow a consistent JSON response format.

&#x20;• **OpenAPl** (Swagger): A specification for describing and documenting RESTful APIs.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3. API: HTTP Verbs</mark>

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines various verbs or methods that indicate thes desired action to be performed on a resource.&#x20;

• Common HTTP verbs include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.&#x20;

**GET: Retrieve a resource or data.**&#x20;

**POST: Submit data to create a new resource.**&#x20;

**PUT: Update or replace an existing resource.**&#x20;

**PATCH: Partially update an existing resource.**&#x20;

**DELETE: Delete a resource.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">4. API: HTTP Status Codes</mark>

HTTP status codes indicate the response status of an HTTP request.&#x20;

**200: 0K The request was successful.**

**201: Created The request resulted in the creation of a new resource.**

**400: Bad Request The request was malformed or invalid.**

**401: Unauthorized Authentication is required to access the resource.**

**404: Not Found The requested resource was not found.**

**500:  Internal Server Error An error occurred on the server side.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">5. API: HTTP Response Headers</mark>

Response headers provide additional information about the response sent by the server. &#x20;

Common response headers include Content-Type, Cache-Control, ETag, and Location.&#x20;

**Content-Type:** Specifies the media type of the response data.&#x20;

**Cache-Control:** Specifies caching directives for the response.&#x20;

**ETag:** Provides an identifier for the specific version of the resource.&#x20;

**Location:** Indicates the URL of a newly created resource.

### <mark style="color:blue;">6. API: Design Patterns</mark>

API design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems in API development.&#x20;

Examples include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, Pagination, Filtering, and Authentication.&#x20;

**CRUD:** Defines the basic operations for persistent storage (Create, Read, Öpdate, Delete).&#x20;

**Pagination:** Splitting large result sets into smaller pages for easier retrieval.&#x20;

**Filtering:** Applying filters to narrow down the results based on specific criteria.&#x20;

**Authentication:** Verifying the identity of API consumers to grant access to protected resources.

### <mark style="color:blue;">7. API: Architecture</mark>

API architecture refers to the overall structure and organization of an API.&#x20;

• Common architectures include REST (Representational State Transfer)  GraphQL.&#x20;

**• REST:** A stateless architecture based on a set of principles, using HTTP ve}bs and resource-based URLs.&#x20;

**• GraphQL:** A query language and runtime for APIs, providing more flexibility in data retrieval by allowing clients to specify the exact data they need.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Security</mark>

API security involves protecting APIs and their data from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.&#x20;

Common security measures include Authentication, Authorization, Encryption, and Rate Limiting.

**Authentication:** Verifying the identity of API consumers.&#x20;

**Authorization:** Determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.&#x20;

**Encryption:** Securing data transmission by encrypting it using protocols like HTTPS.&#x20;

**Rate Limiting:** Limiting the number of requests an API consumer can make within a certain time frame.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Testing</mark>

API testing is the process of validating the behavior and functionality of APIs.&#x20;

Types of API tests include Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and Performance Tests.

**Unit Tests:** Testing individual API components in isolation.&#x20;

**Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between multiple API components or systems.&#x20;

**Performance Tests:** Evaluating the performance and scalability of APIs under different loads and conditions.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Development Platforms and Tools</mark>

API development platforms and tools provide frameworks and utilities to simplify API development.&#x20;

Examples include Express.js, Django Rest Framework, and Swagger.&#x20;

**Express.js:** A popular Node.js framework for building APIs.&#x20;

**Django Rest Framework:** A powerful toolkit for building APIs using Python and Django.&#x20;

**Swagger:** A toolset for designing, building, documenting, and testing APIs.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Implementation Platforms</mark>

API implementation platforms provide hosted environments for deploying and managing APIs.

• Examples include AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints, and Azure API Management.&#x20;

• **AWS API Gateway:** A fully managed service for creating, deploying, and managing APIs on AWS.&#x20;

• **Google Cloud Endpoints:** A distributed API management platform on Google Cloud.&#x20;

• **Azure API Management:** A platform for building, deploying, and scaling APIs on Microsoft Azure.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Performance</mark>

API performance refers to the speed and efficiency of API requests and responses.&#x20;

• Best practices for improving API performance include caching, response compression, and optimizing database queries.&#x20;

• **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the response time.&#x20;

• **Response Compression:** Compressing the response payload to minimize data transfer size.&#x20;

• **Optimizing Database Queries:** Writing efficient database queries to minimize response time.

### <mark style="color:blue;">8. API: Monitoring Tools</mark>

API monitoring tools help track and analyze the performance and availability of APIs.&#x20;

Examples include New Relic, Datadog, and Pingdom.&#x20;

**New Relic:** A comprehensive monitoring and observability platform.&#x20;

**Datadog:** A cloud monitoring and analytics platform with API monitoring capabilities.&#x20;

**Pingdom:** A website and performance monitoring tool that can also monitor API endpoints.
